# Scraped content
scraped_content = '''Child support in Australia is governed by the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and administered by Services Australia. Both parents have a legal obligation to financially support their children, regardless of their relationship status or living arrangements. The Child Support Agency uses a formula to calculate payments based on several factors including the income of both parents, the number of children, the ages of the children, and the care arrangements in place.

Parents can choose to make private arrangements for child support or have it assessed and collected by the government through the Child Support Agency. Private arrangements offer more flexibility but must meet certain legal requirements. If parents cannot agree, the Child Support Agency will make an assessment based on the legislated formula.

The assessment takes into account each parent's adjusted taxable income, which includes salary, wages, business income, investment income, and certain government payments. The formula also considers the costs of raising children and aims to ensure children receive adequate financial support from both parents according to their capacity to pay.

Changes in circumstances such as income variations, changes in care arrangements, or the birth of additional children can affect child support assessments. Parents can apply to have their assessment reviewed if their circumstances change significantly.'''
